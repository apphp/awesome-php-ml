- Ensure suggestions adhere to [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/apphp/awesome-php-ml/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Validate URLs work correctly and don't point to anything malicious.
- Two approvals per pull request is preferred, but not required.
- Simple pull requests fixing typos, formatting and broken links can be merged with a single approval.
